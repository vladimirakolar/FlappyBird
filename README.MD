## Description ##
I present to you a game that is probably one of the most playable.
Flappy Bird is a game that is born from scratch. It is made using Unity programs and ancillary resources such as Gimp, Bfkr, and flatique.com. 
For the game to be functional deserved scripts were created using C # and implemented in the game itself. 
When designing, the use of 2D physics, triggers, parallaxing, object associations, various sounds is repentant.
